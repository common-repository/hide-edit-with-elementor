Hide the Edit With Elementor button and links for pages and posts that you do not want it used for eg. a front page with custom fields.

== Description ==

Hide Edit With Elementor is an add-on plugin for Elementor. It provides a checkbox that only admin can see on the edit screen of pages and posts. Switching it on hides the Edit With Elementor button and links so if you have a website where some posts use custom fields for instance and the main edit box would not be used, Elementor can be hidden as an option. When it is set to hidden, the Edit With Elementor link is also hidden in the admin bar when viewing that page or post and the Edit With Elementor link is removed in the WordPress admin post/page list.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'hide-edit-with-elementor' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the page or post and find a box in the right sidebar called 'Hide Edit With Elementor' to switch it on or off for that page or post.
